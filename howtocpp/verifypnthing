options.cpp
	- not a search strategy but something else entirely
	- --smc <runs>
		- for n runs
		- and x depth?
	- +trace

use successorgenerator::next
	- when this returns
	- select the returned markings with their probability (calc with their domination)
	- assume 1 at first to implement
	- provide statistics 
		- in a/total runs
			- success?
			- success for each transition?

extend nets with domination on transitions
	- parser
	- xml stuff

*extend gui
	- add domination to gui
	- translate this to xml
	- provide statistics














TODO:
add -SMCS as search option
	- print something to test that it works

print something in RDFSS to see what is in "W"
	- so we know something when we extend

extend petri net transitions (edges?) with our weight
	- so they are available when we extend

we should probably learn how much strategy is in the scripts and how much is in the engine?
	- ???

extend RDFSS as SMC
	- where do vector<> thing go?
	- in memory m/n variables?
	- how?


./verifypn-linux64 --xml-queries 1 -s RDFS ../../../test_models/tricky-test003/model.pnml ../../../test_models/tricky-test003/query.xml
	- tricky3 does not use strategy:RDFS?
	- test print in switch case not procd

./verifypn-linux64 --xml-queries 1 -s RDFS ../../../test_models/tricky-test001/model.pnml ../../../test_models/tricky-test001/query.xml
	- but tricky1 does
	- test print in switch case procd

neither procs prints in pop/push from RDFS strategy?????????
